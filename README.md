## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Node.js (for running React.js frontend)
- Python 3.x (for Django backend)
- Docker (for containerization)
- MySql  (database)

### Backend Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository/backend
   ```
3. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file and include the following:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   DEBUG=True
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```
5. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
6. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository/frontend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the frontend server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Both the backend and frontend servers should now be running.

### Docker Setup (Optional)
If you prefer to run the entire stack using Docker:
1. **Build and run containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This will create and run both the backend and frontend services along with the database in separate containers.

## Usage

1. **For Users**:
   - Sign up and log in to the platform.
   - Browse through the available mentors.
   - Book mentorship sessions or join workshops.
   - Provide feedback and rate sessions after completion.

2. **For Mentors**:
   - Set up your profile, including your availability.
   - Manage incoming session requests and workshop bookings.
   - View feedback and adjust availability as needed.

## Testing

To ensure that the backend API works as expected, we use **Pytest** for automated testing.

1. **Run tests**:
   Navigate to the backend directory and run:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

You can create unit tests for both the API endpoints and the database models to ensure full coverage.
